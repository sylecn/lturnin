lturnin - local turnin, run turnin on non cs machine directly.

* Description:

lturnin helps you turn in files on your laptop (in fact, any networked
computer) using the CS turnin system.  You can run turnin on your laptop, just
like you are running turnin on the CS machine.  You can define grader aliases
and homework patterns to make life easier.

Claims:
lturnin is designed for linux, don't ask me why it doesn't work on Windows.
lturnin recommands you login to cs machine using ssh keys.

* Dependence:
lturnin needs these programs to function correctly:
ssh
rsync
grep
sed
cut
which

Most distros already have most of these installed by default. You may need to
install rsync manually though.

ubuntu:
sudo aptitude install rsync

debian:
su -c aptitude install rsync

fedora:
su -c yum install rsync

* Installation:
add executable privilege on turnin script, then put it in one of your $PATH dir.

typically:
chmod +x turnin
sudo cp turnin /usr/local/bin/
or cp turnin ~/bin/

* Usage:

lturnin accepts parameter in option form (ex. --submit) and in command form
(ex. submit). All parameters, namely, ls (list), submit, alias, unalias,
pattern, rmpattern, help, accept both syntax.

** get help
Get a brief list of commands avaliable:
    turnin --help 

** basic usage
The syntax of the origin turnin is accepted in lturnin:
    turnin --submit [grader] [hw] [files...]    submit given files
    turnin --list [grader] [hw]                 list what's submitted

The recommanded equivalent shorthand syntax is:
    turnin [grader] [hw] [files...]             submit given files
    turnin ls [grader] [hw]                     list what's submitted

Notice, if you are submiting directories, don't put a slash at the end,
i.e. use foo instead of foo/. Directories will be turned in recursively.

However that's not the end of the story. I recommand you using aliases and
patterns whenever possible.

** aliases
An alias is used to represent a grader. Wherever you need a <grader> you can
use the grader's alias as well.

Add aliases for graders:
    turnin --alias 345hta nwetzler           345hta is another name for nwetzler
    turnin alias 371pta rekha                371pta is another name for rekha

You can add as many alias for the same grader as you want.
You can redefine an existing alias. New value will override old value.

Remove alias:
    turnin unalias <alias>

List all aliases you have defined:
    turnin alias

** patterns
A pattern contains a <grader> and a <prefix>, it is used to generate the
<grader> and <homework>. A pattern is useful when homeworks have a common
prefix. For example, in CS 371p the homeworks are named cs371pj[1-9].

You can define a hw pattern for it:
    turnin pattern 371p rekha cs371pj          now 371p is a hw pattern

After that you can use the hw pattern when doing submit or list command:
    turnin 371p 3 [files...]                 submit to cs371pj3
    turnin ls 371p 3                         list cs371pj3
# These two commands will be translated to:
#     turnin rekha cs371pj3 [files...]         submit files to cs371pj3
#     turnin ls rekha cs371pj3                 list submitted files for cs371pj3

Remove a pattern:
    turnin rmpattern <pattern>

check patterns you have defined:
    turnin pattern

You can redefine an existing pattern. New value will override old value.

* Implementation:
** brainstorm
search/replace alias with <grader> id
rsync [use filelist option] [files] [cs:~/.turnin/<grader>/<hw>/]
ssh cs "turnin ..."

Config file:
~/.turninrc
user configs
aliases
hw patterns
for example:
------------
CS_USER="sylecn"
# alias 371pta=rekha
# alias 345hta=nwetzler
# pattern 371p=rekha cs371pj
# pattern 345h=nwetzler hw

** final implementation
read the code your self.

~/.turninrc stores user configs, aliases, patterns.
$remote:~/.turnin/ stores files you tried to commit.
rsync is used to transfer the files efficiently, only transfer delta data.

* Tests
filename contains spaces

* TODO
** DONE Ask username when first time run. (no $CONF found)
** DONE add "rmalias" command.
** DONE check availability of the commands listed in [Dependence].
   add option -f --force
** add "username" command.
