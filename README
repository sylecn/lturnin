lturnin - local turnin, a turnin wrapper for UT CS students

* Description:

lturnin helps you turn in files on your laptop using the CS turnin system.
You can run lturnin on your laptop, just like you are running turnin on the CS machine.

lturnin is designed for linux, don't ask me why it doesn't work on Windows.

* Usage:

the syntax of the origin turnin is accepted:
    turnin --submit [grader] [hw] [files ...]
    turnin --list [grader] [hw]

the following syntax is what I like:
    turnin [grader] [hw] [files ...]         submit given files
    turnin ls [grader] [hw-id]               list what's submitted

you can give aliases to graders:
    turnin --alias 345h nwetzler             345h is now the same as nwetzler
    turnin alias 371p rekha                  371p is now the same as rekha

* Implementation:
search/replace alias with <grader> id
rsync [use filelist option] [files] [cs:~/.turnin/<grader>/<hw>/]
ssh cs "turnin ..."

Config file:
~/.turninrc
stores aliases

* Dependence:
ssh
rsync

* tests
  filename contains spaces
