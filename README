lturnin - local turnin, a turnin wrapper for UT CS students

* Description:

lturnin helps you turn in files on your laptop using the CS turnin system.
You can run lturnin on your laptop, just like you are running turnin on the CS machine.

lturnin is designed for linux, don't ask me why it doesn't work on Windows.

* Usage:

the syntax of the origin turnin is accepted:
    turnin --submit [grader] [hw] [files...]
    turnin --list [grader] [hw]

the following syntax is what I like:
    turnin [grader] [hw] [files...]          submit given files
    turnin ls [grader] [hw-id]               list what's submitted

you can give aliases to graders:
    turnin --alias 345hta nwetzler           345hta is another name for nwetzler
    turnin alias 371pta rekha                371pta is another name for rekha

you can define a hw pattern for your classes:
this is only useful when homeworks have a common prefix.
    turnin addclass [class] [grader] [hw-prefix]
    turnin addclass 371p rekha cs371pj         now 371phw is a hw pattern
after that you can use the hw pattern when submiting/listing:
    turnin 371phw 3 [files...]                 submit to hw #3 for class 371p
    turnin ls 371phw 2                         list hw #2 for class 371p

check what classes you have defined:
    turnin listclass

* Implementation:
search/replace alias with <grader> id
rsync [use filelist option] [files] [cs:~/.turnin/<grader>/<hw>/]
ssh cs "turnin ..."

Config file:
~/.turninrc
user configs
aliases
hw patterns
for example:
------------
#configs
CS_USER="sylecn"
#alias
371pta=rekha
345hta=nwetzler
#hw patterns
371p="rekha cs371pj"
345h="nwetzler hw"

* Dependence:
ssh
rsync

* tests
  filename contains spaces

try turnin default.css
upload to host56 as well
